For my first capstone I would like to implement photo filters.

My users are going to be people who like to use filters. In my experience there are many people who like filters from parents/grandparents, to children, men and women.

I plan on using Imgur, giving my users the ability to pick a photo apis and apply a filter to it and reupload it.

My database is going to be Users, Images, and Filters. Images will have a one to many relationship, many filters to one image. Users will have one to many, one user can have many images. My database schema is here.

As I am working with photos, it is all off course. This is what is going to be taking up the majority of my time.

Users will sign up, using an email and a username. They will be able to go to the top posts from Imgur, displaying on one page, and choose an image. Once an image is chosen they will come to a page where they can manipulate the filters, then post it, on this site or to the original site. Using links in a nav bar they will also be able to see images that they have created, see what others have done and upload their own.

This goes above CRUD using the filters. My stretch goal is uploading the photos directly to my database rather than using the intermediary site.
