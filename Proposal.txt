For my first capstone I would like to implement photo filters. 

My users are going to be people who like to use filters. In my experience there are many people who like filters from parents/grandparents, to children, men and women.

I plan on using a photo api, like Imgur or Instagram, giving my users the ability to pick a photo from one of these apis and apply a filter to it and reupload it. Comment on photos, follow other users and create photo feeds, using tags/hashtags.

My database is going to be Users, Posts, Comments, Tags/Hashtags. As I am working with photos, it is all off course. This is what is going to be takeing up the majority of my time. 

Users will sign up, using an email and a username. They will be able to go to the top posts from Imgur/Instagram, displaying on one page, and choose an image. Once an image is choosen they will come to a page where they can manipulate the filters, then post it, on this site or to the orginal site, maybe with an inital comment. Once logged in they will have a feed of photos they want to see or a message telling them to pick some tags to follow. 

This goes above crud using the filters, comments and feed. My stretch goals are uploading the photos directly to my database rather than using the intermediary site, and comment threading.
