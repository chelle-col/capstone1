unsplash.com/api

mycapstone1.heroku.com is where to find my full app. This is a filter app that is able to place a filter on images from unsplash. 
It uses camanjs for the filter effects. Users can apply, and stack filters as well as adujust saturation, vibrance, contrast, exposure, hue, sepia, and noise.

Users can also save their filters to use on other pictures, and they can save the image with the filter attached. 

I will to implement a way to upload and save the user images. Maybe with a way to upload to other websites, like Imagur.
